    "It is worth noticing that, despite the usage of `review_all` method, the **number of fetched reviews is below the total number of reviews reported in Google Play Store for each of these APPs**. This situation can be explained by several factors, from which we highlight three of them: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`reviews_all` only fetches ‚Äúpublicly accessible‚Äù reviews** - i.e., while the Play Store reports the total number of reviews, not all of them are retrievable via scraper since some of them are hidden, limited by location or language or removed over time;\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Country and language filters** - i.e., we're only feching data in english from UK based users, but there are reviews in other languages and from users based in other coutries (especially for universal APPs such as 'Revolut');\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scraping limitations**: Google Play's paginated interface does not expose the total number of reviews in one go, and even though `review_all` is designed to loop until it gets all reviews, it usually achieves a certain limit. Apart from that, Google may intentionally limit the amount of content exposed to unofficial scraping tools as the one we used. \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite this, **the data we have collected is more than enough to extract meaningfull insights and derive conclusions**, since the primary objective of this project is not to extract the total number of reviews per se, but instead to generalize sentiment and key topics for each app."
